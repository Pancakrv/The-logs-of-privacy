Short digital pages on good opsec (Based off the Dark Net Market Bible but this is more for good purposes instead of buying drugs and weapons)

Many pages will be added, this is only being added at so little pages cause I'm having headaches trying to make new ones
Recommended that you use the cat command to view the files in a Linux terminal if you have one available
