Opsec: Operations security is VITAL for not being raided, swatted, doxxed, etc. So, how do you get good at it? Review the such and see if you can approve on thy listed.

Keeping Secrets: If it's lover to family, family to strangers, you're never forced to tell the truth. Whilst being hard to do if you like coming off as friendly, faking what you do, who you are and your intentions is as easy as cutting people off for a few months then coming back to say you've gotten better to show a fake uprise.

Identity Masking: If someone tries to log into your account without the password then they might try reseting your password to annoy you with emails. Well, most social medias show a few numbers and letters out of your email, now let's say your name is Xavier Mac, if a hacker gets "X**i***ac*9@gmail.com" then they have a general idea of what your name might be, this is not good. How would we counter this? By using emails that can't be made into a name, at least not your name. So if you make your email a bunch of random characters like "Ehianomao94@gmail.com" then it'll look like a name to the attacker but in reality, that's not you, nowhere NEAR you infact.

Shown Objects: Lets say you show your room off, that's fine. Lets say there's an award with your name on it there too, not fine. It's always important to quad-check your video for uncensored info about yourself, such being (but not limited to), your football jersey, specially signed basketball, a sign saying "_____'s room" and more that could specially designate you to your real identity

Other People: As much as you care about your own privacy, aknowledge the privacy of those around you. If you be a privacy enthusiast and then show your friends first name with a picture of them, you're probably not a cool person. As nice as it is for uploading your friend for rape awareness (if that happened to them), it's still giving out their first name and story of them. This rule mainly applies if they don't already share their name but still a consideration to think about
