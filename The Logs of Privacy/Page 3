Devices: What kinds of devices are the BEST for privacy? Well it comes down to if you want a phone or laptop. If you're looking for a phone, there's 2 main options. A, get an old phone so you can remove the battery when not in use. B, upgrading your phone to GrapheneOS. And I also recommend a faraday cage for blocking WI-FI, NFC and other ways the feds might track you via local connections. For laptops, I'd look into ones with open source hardware, whilst being expensive, it's 100% worth the investment
