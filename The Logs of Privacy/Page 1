OS Choice: Whilst your OS may not seem to matter in privacy, Microsoft apps tracking your mouse movements and keystrokes is not liable. This could also go for MacOS, even while still claiming to be more private, who can fact check when the code is closed source? That's why Linux distrobutions should be a BIG option, or at least interest you into the idea as a viable option for a daily ran OS. "But which ones are the best for me?", look no further than: Qubes, Debian, Arch. While Qubes is the best option here, Debian and Arch allow for easy customization for your liking. But if that's still too "bloated" for your liking, you may want to try LFS (Linux From Scratch) to your OS before you get a knock on the door. But even with any of those OS' you may still leave traces (Way less with Qubes tho) and if you feel anxious of your OS being checked by the alphabet boys or police, you may want to try live booting Tails OS for it's amnesic properties of leaving no data of what happened on it so you can access your anime waifu collection without weird looks.
