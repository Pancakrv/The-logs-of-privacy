Purchases: How would one make safe purchases online and on the dark web? Here are some options. A, using a nearby neighbor's house and then having them take it to your house, while this uses human interaction, it's a neighbor, just make sure they don't go through the package. B, using a PO box might be a consideration if you dislike talking and interaction, whilst making you leave your house it also supplies you with a secure way to recieve packages without the risk of your neighbor going through it. C, using an empty house as a drop off point, if there's no one there, who'll be there to go through your mail? Another part of purchases is doing it without giving our your card info, while you can do purchases with Bitcoin, a lot of shops don't deal with it. So you might wanna try, a website that makes a fake card and uses the money off of your card to pay, this is secure if you trust the website enough. Another way is using gift cards for every online purchase, since they're not owned by a bank, it's a lot harder to personally identify you.
